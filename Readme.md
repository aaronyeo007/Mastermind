General Assembly - Project 1

Project Name: Mastermind

Project Overview
This is my first project assignment for General Assembly's Software Immersive Program. The project requirements are to create an interactive game in the browser with the use of separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files. JavaScript shall be used for any DOM manipulation triggered by a browser event.

Description
Mastermind is a puzzle game in which a code breaker will try to guess the secret color code the code maker has come up with. 
1. The code breaker has 10 rows to guess 4 color codes.
2. After each row, the code breaker receives feedback from the code maker in the form of red and white hint pegs.
3. Each white peg means that one of the guessed pegs is correct, but is in the wrong hole.
4. Each red peg means that one of the guessed pegs is correct, and is in the right hole.
5. The order of the white and black pegs does not matter.
6. Red hint peg takes precedence over the white hint peg.
  i.e. if the secret code contains 1 green, and the code breaker guessed 2 green, then the code maker gives 1 red hint peg if one of the green is in the correct position, so the code maker has played red peg in preference to white peg.

Reason for choosing this game
1. This game will help me review and understand JavaScript and CSS better.

Game Components
1. Game Initialization
2. Playing the Game
3. Announcing the Result

Technologies Being Used:
HTML and CSS for the website and JavaScript during the game.

To-dos:
1. Further features to consider - dragging and dropping.
2. Consider further improving the algorithm used to compare secret codes against the breaker codes.

Challenges:
1. Spent quite a fair bit of time narrowing down the bugs due to incorrect algorithms.
2. Earlier versions of the game design were lengthy and repetitive and lack a tier-down approach to the game flow.
